                <p>Native plants are plants that occur in 
                    the region that they evolved in. 
                    They are the backbone to our ecosystems: 
                    they provide life to crucial animal and insect species, 
                    are optimized to support the local climate, 
                    and are naturally beautiful. <br>
                    However, harmful invasive plants tend to overtake these 
                    plants in their environment, causing widespread description 
                    to the ecosystem.</p>
