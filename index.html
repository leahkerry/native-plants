        <div class ="three">Native plants are plants that occur in 
        the region that they evolved in. 
        They are the backbone to our ecosystems: 
        they provide life to crucial animal and insect species, 
        are optimized to support the local climate, 
        and are naturally beautiful. <br>
        However, harmful invasive plants tend to overtake these 
        plants in their environment, causing widespread description 
        to the ecosystem. <br>

        <div class ="seven">The native movement</div>
        <div class ="eight">A few years ago, most people would not have recognized what a native plant is or why it was important. 
            <br>
            Recently, as environmental destruction has become more of a pressing issue, we have become more mindful of our impact on the earth. With that, many have learned about the importance of natives and made the switch.
